<p>I just finished building a dashboard that displays Indonesiaâ€™s minimum wage for each province. It took me a few days to complete, but Iâ€™m extremely pleased with the outcome. I used Plotly to build the dashboard, and I utilized data from Badan Pusat Statistik to ensure that the information was accurate and up-to-date. Best of all, I deployed the dashboard on Render and made all of the source code available on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/datawithalvin/indonesia-provinces-minimum-wage">page</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, my goal was to create a user-friendly dashboard that would allow people to easily access information about minimum wage rates in their respective provinces. By displaying how much minimum wage rates have increased each year, I hope to encourage people to be aware of their rights and take action if they feel that theyâ€™re being underpaid. Everyone deserves to be paid fairly for the work that they do.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in learning more about minimum wage rates in Indonesia, check out my dashboard on <a href="https://t.co/cNNpjBvgHS">this web</a>. Thanks for reading, and I hope that this tool will be useful for you and many others!</p>
