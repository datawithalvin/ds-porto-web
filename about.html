    As a data scientist, I've gained experience in numerous aspects of data work, such as data collection, cleaning, analysis, and modeling, in my role at an IT consultancy. This work has enriched my problem-solving and communication skills alongside my technical knowledge.

    My current fascination lies with Bayesian analysis, Graph Theory, and Natural Language Processing. These fields offer unique ways to understand and decode complex data - Bayesian analysis through statistical understanding, Graph Theory through relationship visualization, and Natural Language Processing through the combination of linguistics and machine learning.

    I am always eager to discuss the ever-evolving field of data science, finding immense joy in decoding the world through data.
